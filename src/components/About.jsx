                    Hi, I'm Alan.
                    <h2 classname="primary">I love to build amazing apps. I am a software engineer interested in making network connections and learning as much about coding as I can. In my previous roles as an educator and corrections officer, I learned valuable methods to tackle unique problems and overcome adversity in a number of difficult situations. I devised how to create unique solutions to unique problems and was pushed to grow as a result of the various situations I faced. My ability to adapt and thrive in a number of different environments has allowed me to excel in a number of roles.
